A simple arcade game for a class project. This game was made using Processing 3.5.4

The game consists of two game modes: bone rush and pumpkin rush. Instead of having difficulty levels, the user can choose between two different games altogether. 
In bone rush, the player uses the arrow keys to move the player character left and right. The objective is to survive as long as possible and achieve a high score. The character is stuck to the bottom of the screen and must evade falling bones that cover different sections of the play area. The bones fall in a random pattern. If the bones touch the player, the game is over, and the user can choose to start again. There are also randomly generated candies, which the player can collide with to eat them and gain 100 points. When the player hits a candy, it pops and disappears. As the player collects points, the bones and candies fall faster in proportion with the player’s score. This way, the game gets progressively more difficult.  

In pumpkin rush, the player moves in all directions using the arrow keys. The objective is to evade the pumpkins that spawn as long as possible and achieve a high score. Pumpkins spawn randomly in all directions, and with different velocities, bouncing around the game space indefinitely. If a pumpkin touches the player, the player dies and has the option to start again. Candy can spawn sometimes, and if the player collects it by colliding with it, it disappears along with the pumpkin which has most recently spawned, adding 100 to the player’s score. As the player’s score grows, the pumpkins move faster. Also, the pumpkins spawn slightly more frequently than the candy so, given enough time, the player will have to deal with at most six pumpkins bouncing around in the arena.  
Both game modes have sound effects for when the player eats candy, when they die, and when a game is started.   

There is no victory in this game, only a high score, and there is no narrative.   

There is also a menu system implemented, which allows users to quit at any given moment, as well as an option to return to the main menu. There is also a game mode select screen. All the buttons in the game (menu, game select, exit, etc.)  are activated on button clicks. The buttons are responsive, with indicators when the mouse is over them, as well as sound cues when clicked. There is royalty free background Halloween themed music, which loops while the game is being played.     

This is a casual arcade game, open to a wide demographic of users. Anyone from ages 3-99 can play this game. It is child-friendly, simple, and fun. There are no bugs, and the game runs smoothly. People who like to play games to get their minds of the mundane parts of life would be attracted to this game, but it is not limited to casual gamers, as the game can be played competitively (there is no limit to the high score).
